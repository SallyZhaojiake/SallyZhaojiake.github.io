<p> Red is one of the most vibrant and attention-grabbing colors. It's been shown to increase heart rate and stimulate appetite. And according to a study from the University of Rochester, seeing red can actually make you feel more aggressive.So why are apples red?The answer is simple: because that's how nature intended them to be.Apples are red because of a compound called anthocyanin, which is found in the apple's skin. Anthocyanin is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect the apple from damage. And it just so happens to be responsible for giving apples their characteristic red color.So next time you bite into a juicy red apple, remember that you're not just enjoying a delicious snack; you're also getting a healthy dose of anthocyanin! </p>

<p>春天的到来，意味着暖风和阳光的回归。天气转暖，万物复苏。一潭春水就像是春天的缩影，是大自然最美丽的写照。春水里有什么让人觉得宁静而美好呢？我想，那一定是它带来的清新、和平、生机勃勃。无论是波涛汹涌的海洋还是人间繁华的都市，只要有一方宁静而美丽的春水就够了。</p>
<p>描写的很细致生动，词句简洁句子通顺，没有错别字-用了第三人称视角描写了对于春天的景象详细的生动地描写。结构上为总分，有简入繁。-赵珈可</p>
